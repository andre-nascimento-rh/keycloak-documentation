= Allow setting a base URL when configuring the hostname

In this release, we are introducing two additional server options to set a base URL for front end and Admin Console URLs.

* `hostname-url`
* `hostname-admin-url`

More details can be found at the https://www.keycloak.org/server/hostname[Configuring the Hostname Guide].

= Improvements to `kc.bat` when running Keycloak on Windows

In this release, we are making important changes to `kc.bat` to give the same experience as when running on Linux.

= Upgrade of embedded H2 database

{project_name} ships for development purposes with an H2 database driver. As it is intended for development purposes only, it should never be used in a production environment.

In this release, the H2 driver has been upgraded from version 1.x to version 2.x.
See link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for details on how to migrate.

= Keycloak Operator upgrade

We are happy to announce that Keycloak Operator is no longer a tech preview feature. We added new functionality as well as quality of life improvements. Some of them resulted to breaking changes.

Itâ€™s important to emphasize that none of these breaking changes will come into effect automatically. Please, read our link:{upgradingguide_link}[{upgradingguide_name}] for more information.
